## Characterizing the human hippocampus in aging and Alzheimer's disease using a computational atlas derived from ex vivo MRI and histology.

# Description

Alzheimer’s Disease affects millions around the globe. In America alone, one in ten people aged 65 or older live with Alzheimer’s. There are various medical imaging modalities that have been used to better detect and understand the progression of the disease. In recent years, near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has received much more attention in terms of functionality and noninvasive monitoring of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations. The current goal of this project is to use fNIRS techniques to capture a specific cognitive entity into an association between cognitive reserve and disease onset. Cognitive reserve, while it remains complex, is a measure of one’s cognitive resistance to dementia-related symptoms as measured by paper and pencil tests as well as by infrared imaging technology (i.e., fNIRS).  One possible method in which this may be possible is to look at creating a predictive computerized model which associates cognitive make-up with the longitudinal anatomical changes to capture a greater detail within each individual case study.
